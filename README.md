# Zumaan

A text-based implementation of the classic tile-matching puzzle video game **Zuma**, written in x86 Assembly Language (MASM).

## 🎮 Overview

Zumaan recreates the core mechanics of the popular arcade game within a console environment. The player controls a rotating shooter (the "bandook") to fire colored balls at a chain of incoming balls moving along a set path.
